Enables V-core Pro to use the EVA platform . Up to Easy Mod 1.2.1 there is no additional hardware required to use Easy Mod on V-core Pro. Scroll down for more information about the specific versions and what's planned for the future. Printing \u00b6 You can print the parts with 0.2mm or even 0.3mm layer height. Use 4 perimeters to make them strong (~1.8mm wall width), infill is not that important - 20% will be fine. No supports needed . Roadmap \u00b6 2.0.0 (Future) \u00b6 This release is going to be around reducing the weight of the X gantry of V-core Pro by shifting to a MGN12 rail. 1.2.1 (Current) \u00b6 This version gives back the Y space that Easy Mod originally stole. To regain that Y one needs to do one of two things: use the included bed_corner parts that move the bed -10mm in Y move the whole gantry -10mm in Y (this will be difficult on 3 axis V-core) I used those bed_corner parts for a very long time on my V-core - nothing melted (PETG). Upgrade from 1.2.0 \u00b6 The xy_joiner parts did not change. The corner and bed parts are new.
